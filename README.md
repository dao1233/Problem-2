# Problem 2
Solution for Problem 2
In this solution, we create a Car class containing some information of a car such as id, brand, model, color, manufacture year and registration number.
We base on these information to classify and write to a text file for each car. In this case, a list of cars of a given brand is written to Brand_cars.txt, a list of cars of a given model that have been in use for more than n years is stored in old_cars.txt, and a list of cars of a given year of manufacture, the price of which is higher than the specified one is stored in cars_price.txt
Result:
